## Gameplay

- **Attack:**  
  Press `J` to attack. Chain up to 4-hit combos if timed correctly. Jump attacks can be performed while airborne for extra damage.
- **Dodge:**  
  Press `F` to roll. Rolling uses stamina and allows you to evade attacks.  
  **Perfect Dodge:** Time your roll precisely during dangerous attacks to achieve complete invulnerability. Only a perfect dodge will make you truly invulnerable; regular rolls provide only brief evasion.
- **Movement:**  
  Use `A`/`D` or Left/Right Arrow to move your knight.
- **Jump:**  
  Press `Space` to jump.
- **Stamina:**  
  Attacking and rolling use stamina, which regenerates automatically.
- **Game Over:**  
  When your health reaches zero, the game ends and the UI shows the game over screen.
